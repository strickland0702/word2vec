    "# SI 630: Homework 2: Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will have you implementing word2vec using PyTorch and let you familiarize yourself with building more complex neural networks and the larger PyTorch development infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, this homework consists of a few major parts:\n",
    "1. Implement a `Corpus` class that will load the dataset and convert it to a sequence of token ids\n",
    "2. Implement negative sampling to select tokens to be used as negative examples of words in the context\n",
    "3. Create your dataset of positive and negative examples per context and load it into PyTorch's `DataLoader` to use for sampling\n",
    "4. Implement a `Word2Vec` class that is a PyTorch neural network\n",
    "5. Implement a training loop that samples a _batch_ of target words and their respective positive/negative context words\n",
    "6. Implement rare word removal and frequent word subsampling\n",
    "7. Run your model on the full dataset for at least one epoch\n",
    "8. Do the exploratory parts of the homework\n",
    "9. Make a copy of this notebook and change your implementation so it learns word vectors with less bias\n",
    "\n",
    "After Step 5, you should be able to run your word2vec implementation on a small dataset and verify that it's learning correctly. Once you can verify everything is working, proceed with steps 6 and beyond. **Please note that this list is a general sketch and the homework PDF has the full list/description of to-dos and all your deliverables.**"

The trainin code will look surprisingly similar at times to your pytorch code from Homework 1 since all networks share the same base training setup. However, we'll add a few new elements to get you familiar with more common training techniques. \n",

    "5. Train your model \n",

    "Two new elements show up. First, we'll be using `DataLoader` which is going to sample data for us and put it in a batch (and also convert the data to `Tensor` objects. You can iterate over the batches and each iteration will return all the items eventually, one batch at a time (a full epoch's worth).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second new part is using `tensorboard`. As you might have noticed in Homework 1, training neural models can take some time. [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/) is a handy web-based view that you can check during training to see how the model is doing. We'll use it here and periodically log a running sum of the loss after a set number of steps. The Homework write up has a plot of what this looks like. We'll be doing something simple here with tensorboard but it will come in handy later as you train larger models (for longer) and may want to visually check if your model is converging. TensorBoard was initially written for another deep learning framework, TensorFlow, but proved so useful it was ported to work in PyTorch too and is [easy to integrate](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To start training, we recommend training on the `wiki-bios.10k.txt` dataset. This data is small enough you can get through an epoch in a few minutes (or less) while still being large enough you can test whether the model is learning anything by examining common words. Below this cell we've added a few helper functions that you can use to debug and query your model. In particular, the `get_neighbors()` function is a great way to test: if your model has learned anything, the nearest neighbors for common words should seem reasonable (without having to jump through mental hoops). An easy word to test on the `10k` data is \"january\" which should return month-related words as being most similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Since we're training biographies, the text itself will be skewed towards words likely to show up biographices--which isn't necessary like \"regular\" text. You may find that your model has few instances of words you think are common, or that the model learns poor or unusual neighbors for these. When querying the neighbors, it can help to think of which words you think are likely to show up in biographies on Wikipedia and use those as probes to see what the model has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're convinced the model is learning, switch to the `med` data and train your model as specified in the PDF. Once trained, save your model using the `save()` function at the end of the notebook. This function records your data in a common format for word2vec vectors and lets you load the vectors into other libraries that have more advanced functionality. In particular, you can use the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html) code in other notebook included to explore the vectors and do simple vector analogies."

    "# FINAL PART: DO THIS LAST AND READ CAREFULLY\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start this part, you need to have a fully working solution and completed the exploratory part of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once you are ready, create a copy of your working notebook and call it `Debiased Word2Vec.ipynb`. Do not do this part in your working code for the assignment!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seriously, save your code in a new file and then start reading the rest of these instructions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, hopefully you're reading these in a new file... For this last part of the assignment, we're going to _change_ how word2vec learns at a fundamental level. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed in your exploratory analysis, the word2vec model learns to weird and sometimes biased associations between words. In particular, your word2vec model has likely learned some unfortunate gender biases, e.g., that the vector for \"nurse\" is closer to \"woman\" than \"man\". The algorithm itself isn't to blame since it is learning these from a corpus (here, Wikipedia biographies) that contain biases already based on how people write. Wikipedia [is](http://markusstrohmaier.info/documents/2015_icwsm2015_wikipedia_gender.pdf) [well](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~mounia/Papers/wiki_gender_bias.pdf) [known](https://www.academia.edu/download/64856696/genderanalysisofWikipediabiostext_self_archived.pdf) for having gender biases in how it writes about men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note**: Some times this bias-learning behavior is useful: We can use word2vec to uncover these biases and analyze their trends, like this PNAS paper did for [looking at bias in news writing along multiple dimensions of identity](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/16/E3635.full.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last part of the homework, we'll ask how we might try to _prevent_ these biases by modifying the training. You won't need to solve this problem by any means, but the act of trying to reduce the biases will open up a whole new toolbox for how you (the experimenter/practioner) can change how and what models learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many potential ways to _debias_ word embeddings so that their representations are not skewed along one \"latent dimension\" like gender. In this homework, you'll be trying one of a few different ideas for how to do it. **You are not expected to solve gender bias! This part of the assignment is to have to start grappling with a hard challenge but there is no penalty for doing less-well!** \n",
    "\n",
    "One common technique to have models avoid learning bias is similar to another one you already&mdash;**regularization**. In Logistic Regression, we could use L2 regularization to have our model avoid learning $\\beta$ weights that are overfit to specific or low-frequency features by adding a regularizer penalty where the larger the weight, the more penalty the model paid. Recall that this forces the model to only pick the most useful (generalizable) weights, since it has to pay a penalty for any non-zero weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "In word2vec, we can adapt the idea to think about whether our model's embeddings are closer or farther to different gender dimensions. For example, if we consider the embedding for \"president\", ideally, we'd want it to be equally similar to the embeddings for \"man\" and \"woman\". One idea then is to penalize the model based on how uneven the similarity is. We can do this by directly modifying the loss:\n",
    "```\n",
    "loss = loss_criteron(preds, actual_vals) + some_bias_measuring_function(model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the `some_bias_measuring_function` function takes in your model as input and returns how much bias you found. Continuing our example, we might implement it in pseudocode as\n",
    "```\n",
    "def some_bias_measuring_function(model):\n",
    "    pres_woman_sim = cosine_similarity(model, \"president\", \"woman\")\n",
    "    pres_man_sim = cosine_similarity(model, \"president\", \"man\")\n",
    "    return abs(pres_woman_sim - pres_man_sim)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This simple example would penalize the model for learning a representation of \"president\" that is more simular to one of the two words. Of course, this example is overly simple. Why just \"president\"? Why just \"man\" and \"woman\"? Why not other words or other gender-related words or other gender identities?? \n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea might be to just make the vectors for \"man\" and \"woman\" be as similar as possible:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def some_bias_measuring_function(model):\n",
    "    # cosine similarity is in [-1,1] but we mostly expect it in [0,1]\n",
    "    man_woman_sim = cosine_similarity(model, \"man\", \"woman\")\n",
    "    # penalize vectors that are not maximally similar, and avoid the edge case \n",
    "    # of negative cosine similarity\n",
    "    return 1 - max(man_woman_sim, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this works in practice because PyTorch is fantastic about tracking the gradient with respect to the loss. This ability lets us easily define a loss function so that our word2vec model (1) learns to predict the right context words while (2) avoids learning biases. If we compare this code to the numpy part of Homework 1, it's easy to see how powerful PyTorch can be as an experimenter for helping you control what and how your models learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to expand this general approach by coming up with an extension to word2vec that adds some new term to the `loss` value that penalizes bias in the gender dimension. There is no right way to do this and even some right-looking approaches may not work&mdash;or might word but simultaneously destroy the information in the word vectors (all-zero vectors are unbiased but also uninformative!). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion:** You may need to weight your bias term in the loss function (remember that $\\lambda_1 x_1 + \\lambda_2 x_2$ interpolation? This is sort of similar) so that your debiasing regularizer doesn't overly penalize your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have generated your model, record word vector similarities for the pairs listed on canvas in `word-pair-similarity-predictions.csv` where your file writes a result like\n",
    "```\n",
    "word1,word2,sim\n",
    "dog,puppy,0.91234123\n",
    "woman,preseident,0.81234\n",
    "```\n",
    "You'll record the similarity for each pair of words in the file and upload it to CodaLab, which is kind of like Kaggle but lets use a custom scoring program. We'll evaluate your embeddings based on how unbiased they are and how much information they still capture after debiasing. **Your grade does not depend on how well you do in CodaLab, just that you tried something and submitted.** However, the CodaLab leaderboard will hopefully provide a fun and insightful way of comparing just how much bias we can remove from our embeddings.\n",
